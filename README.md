This repository contains files in two formats: PDF for ease of reading and .nb (Mathematica Notebook) for ease of use. 
Each file contains detailed calculations and analyses related to the research paper "Bursts of Coalescence within Population Pedigrees Whenever Big Families Occur". 
Below is a brief description of each file:

PiBF_row_derivation: This file includes the calculations for deriving the 10x10 matrix $\widetilde{\Pi}_N^{\rm BF}$, which describes the Markovian dynamics of the joint ancestral process as discussed in the paper.

Lemma_2_second_moment: Contains detailed calculations for Lemma 2 presented in the Appendix of the paper.

Lemma_4_mixed_moment: This file provides the calculations for Lemma 4, also found in the Appendix of the paper.
